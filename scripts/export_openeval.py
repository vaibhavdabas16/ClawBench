"""Export a ClawBench batch's rescore-summary.json to an EvalPort ResultSet.

EvalPort (https://github.com/adhabnr-ux/evalport) is a small open interchange
format for portable LLM/agent evaluation results (TestCase/Grader/Result/
ResultSet, JSON Schema + a Python/TS SDK). This script is optional and
additive: it only *reads* files ClawBench already writes after a run
finishes (run-meta.json, the per-run judge verdict, rescore-summary.json)
and writes a new, separate resultset.json alongside them. It does not
change make_run_meta(), the two-stage scoring pipeline, clawbench-rescore,
or any other part of the runner/eval code, and it adds no dependency for
anyone who isn't using it -- see the module-level NOTE below on the one
optional import.

Discussed and scoped in https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/ClawBench/issues/322.
This is the *results* side, complementing the existing *test-case* import
adapters (clawbench-harbor-adapt, clawbench-edgebench-adapt) that run the
other direction: those convert someone else's test-case definitions into
ClawBench's own eval format so ClawBench can run them; this converts a
ClawBench run's own output into a portable results format so it can be
read next to output from any other EvalPort-aware benchmark.

Usage:

    uv run python scripts/export_openeval.py <batch_dir> \\
        --run-id batch-20260902-140000 \\
        --started-at 2026-09-02T14:00:00Z

<batch_dir> is a directory containing rescore-summary.json (written by
`clawbench-rescore` / scripts/rescore.sh) and the run-meta.json files it
was rolled up from. Writes <batch_dir>/resultset.json by default; pass
--out to write elsewhere, or --stdout to print instead of writing a file.

--run-id and --started-at are required: rescore-summary.json records
neither a run id nor a start timestamp for the batch, so there is nothing
honest to default them to. --rubric selects which of
rescore-summary.json's ["rubrics"] to score against (defaults to the
first one that ran, matching clawbench-rescore's own default of
"lenient").

What ClawBench actually emits (verified against the current source in
src/clawbench/runner/run_support/metadata.py, src/clawbench/eval/rescore.py,
and src/clawbench/runner/judge_llm.py -- not just docs/scoring.md, which
describes an idealized/older shape):

* run-meta.json (make_run_meta()) carries test_case, instruction, model,
  harness, intercepted, result_category, failure_category,
  adjusted_eligible, duration_seconds, among other fields. It does NOT
  carry judge_match or final_pass -- docs/scoring.md describes those as
  merged in, but the actual merge point is the rescoring step below, and
  even there no field is literally named final_pass.
* The per-run judge verdict (judge_llm.json for the default "lenient"
  rubric, judge.json for "strict" -- JUDGE_FILE in rescore.py) has a
  `match` key (True/False/None) and a `reason` string (judge_llm.py's
  judge_request()).
* rescore-summary.json (aggregate_batch()) rolls a batch into n_total,
  n_intercepted, judge_model, rubrics, and a tasks[] list of per-task rows
  shaped {"task_id", "test_case", "intercepted", "match_<rubric>",
  "reason_<rubric>"} for each rubric that ran. tasks[] rows do NOT carry
  instruction/model/harness -- those live only in each run's own
  run-meta.json, so this script also walks the batch dir for those files
  to enrich each Result.

Mapping to EvalPort's data model (spec/SPEC.md in the EvalPort repo):

* One ClawBench run -> one EvalPort Result. test_case (or task_id as
  fallback) becomes test_case_id. The two-stage scoring pipeline
  (interception, then LLM judge) becomes two GraderResult entries --
  gr_interception and gr_judge_match -- so the mechanism ClawBench
  actually uses is visible in the result, not collapsed into one opaque
  score. Result.passed is `intercepted AND judge_match is True`, matching
  the `final_pass = intercepted AND judge_match` rule documented in
  docs/scoring.md.
* A batch's rescore-summary.json -> one EvalPort ResultSet.

NOTE on the evalport-sdk import: this script does NOT require
evalport-sdk to run -- the conversion itself is pure stdlib. If
evalport-sdk (`pip install evalport-sdk`) happens to be installed, the
script uses it to validate the ResultSet it produces against the real
EvalPort JSON Schema before writing it out, and to print a clear error if
validation fails; if it isn't installed, the script skips that step and
says so. Either way, nothing in ClawBench's own pyproject.toml dependency
list changes.
