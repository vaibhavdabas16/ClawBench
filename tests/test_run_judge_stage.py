"""Regression test for a missing/invalid --judge model (issue #302).

Before the fix, load_model_config() called sys.exit() on a bad model name.
When that happened for the *judge* model — after the agent had already run
and produced results — the resulting SystemExit escaped both the judge
stage's `except Exception` and run()'s top-level `except Exception`, since
SystemExit is a BaseException, not an Exception. The process died without
ever calling write_run_meta(), silently discarding the run's results.

The fix has two halves, one test each:

  * A bad --judge is now rejected at startup, before the agent runs at all,
    so a command-line typo costs seconds instead of half an hour.
  * A judge failure that only surfaces mid-run is caught and degraded to a
    judge_setup_failed outcome, and the run still reaches write_run_meta().

These drive run_mod.main() through a fully mocked agent run, skipping the
docker/network/email side effects.
