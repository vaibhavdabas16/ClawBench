"""``clawbench-edgebench-judge`` — score ClawBench evidence as EdgeBench structured_json.

EdgeBench (SForge) judges an agent's *submitted archive* offline in an ephemeral
Judge container: its ``eval_cmd`` reads the evidence, prints a
``structured_json`` block, and SForge parses the ``score``/``valid`` from it.

ClawBench's two-stage reward maps onto this cleanly: the Work-side interceptor
captures the target request into ``evidence/interception.json``; this module
(the Judge ``eval_cmd``) re-scores that captured evidence — Stage-1 ∧ Stage-2 —
and emits the structured_json block SForge expects. Because the agent controls
the submitted evidence, Stage-1 is **recomputed** against ``task["eval_schema"]``
(url_pattern + method + const body/params) rather than trusting the agent's
``intercepted`` flag; Stage-2 is the LLM judge over the verified request.

Judge config comes from ``CLAWBENCH_JUDGE_*`` env (injected into the Judge
container via ``SFORGE_JUDGE_EXTRA_ENV``); ``--no-judge`` scores Stage-1 only.
